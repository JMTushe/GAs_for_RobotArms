# GAs_for_RobotArms
A simple implementation of Genetic Algorithms for solving a robotics problem.

# GA.py
This is the Genetic Algorithm class that can be freely customized for specific needs.
- Mutation can be customized
- Breeding method
- Selection Process

# 3DOF_GA.py
Main file where I show how a GA can be used to try and 'guess' the joint angles needed to achieve a specific end effector position.
